# Python OOP Projects â€“ Complete Python Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu ðŸŽ“

This repository contains a collection of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** projectsâ€”miniâ€‘apps and toolsâ€”developed as part of the **Complete Python Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu** on Udemy.

## ðŸš€ Projects Overview

The following list highlights each project in this repo. Explore the code to see how OOP concepts like **classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and magic methods** have been applied.

- **Abstract class, Multiple inheritance, Vector class**
- **Automatic Tinder Bot**
- **Blackjack game**
- **Binary files handler**
- **Coffee Machine simulation**
- **Habit Tracker**
- **Health Spreadsheet Manager**
- **Internet Speed Bot**
- **LinkedIn Automatic Application Bot**
- **Mile-to-Kilometre Converter**
- **Online Admission Project**
- **Selenium Web Scraping Bot**
- **Song Time Machine**
- **Cookie Click Bot**
- **Flash Card Game**
- **Password Manager**
- **Magic methods demo:** `_getitem_`, `_setitem_`, `__index__`, etc.

## ðŸ§© Additional Code Files

In addition to the above interactive tools, this repo contains several script files demonstrating fundamental Python concepts and OOP utility patterns:

- `sqlite3.py` â€“ Basic database manipulation using SQLite3
- `bill.py` â€“ A bill/invoice handler
- `complex.py` â€“ Complex number class and operations
- `datetime.py` â€“ Custom datetime-handling examples
- `factorial.py` â€“ Factorial calculation class
- `fibonacci.py` â€“ Fibonacci number generator class
- `mainn.py` â€“ Entry point script for testing project components
- `matrix.py` â€“ Custom matrix operations (e.g. addition, multiplication)
- `polynomial.py` â€“ Polynomial class with operations
- `singleton class.py` â€“ Demonstrates singleton design pattern
- `student.py` â€“ Custom `Student` class (could include methods like `__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.)

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo Matters

This collection is a showcase of handsâ€‘on practiceâ€”ranging from fun miniâ€‘apps to more structured toolsâ€”all built using OOP principles. It demonstrates:

- **Reusability & Modularity:** separate classes encapsulate wellâ€‘defined behavior
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** code extension via subclassing and overridden methods
- **Magic/Dunder Methods:** customizing object behavior with Python internals
- **Design Patterns:** implementing patterns like Singleton for learning robustness

## âœ… Skills Gained

By completing these projects, youâ€™ve gained practical command over:

- Class and object design
- Encapsulation for cleaner interfaces
- Inheritance and method overriding for code reuse
- Operator overloading and custom behaviors via magic methods
- Building functional mini-apps with real-world logic

## ðŸ“š Course Link & Certificate

These projects were completed as part of the **Complete Python Bootcamp** by Dr. Angela Yu. I successfully earned the certificate, and the OOP concepts demonstrated here are directly from the course curriculum.

**Explore any project in this repo** to see how it works and how OOP concepts are applied.
